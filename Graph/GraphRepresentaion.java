Graph Representation :
1. Adjacency Matrix :
Represented by matrix V X V
Space Required : O(v x v)
Operations :
check u and v are adjacent
Add/ remove edges : make matrix element 1 or 0
Problem with Adjacency matrix is it also
store matrix value which is not present in 0
to avoid this we use adjacency list

2. Adjacency List

package Graph;
/*
Graph is set of node and its connected edges
it can be represented as
G = (v, E)
where V= Vertices   E=Edges
Two types of graph
1. Directed Graph:
One directional traversal.
Indegree: Number of edges coming to it
Outdegree: Number of edges going out to it.

Maximum number of edges is |V| * (|V|-1)
Bidirectional traversal between two nodes.
2. Undirected Graph: Degree of graph means how many edges are passing
through it.

Few terms in graph
Walk : Traveled from node v1-v2-v4-v2. Here repeation are allowed
Path : treveled from node without repeation to node
Cyclic : a cyclic node connectd in cycle

Weighted Graph and Unweighted graph :
weighted Graph : a vertices connected to another vertices with given distence
of edges
eg. two cityes connected with road with distence x .

Overview of sorting Algorithms
On the basis of sorting criteria we can use specific algorithm for sorting
1. Binary Array : Partition of quick sort we can consider for sorting
    Lometo Hoare, Naive approach

 2. Array with three values:
 3. Array of size n and small ranged values : size is 1000 and values are from 200 to 300 only
    for such array we have to use counting sort Algorithm
 4: Array with high range then we can go for Radix Sort
 5: Array of uniformly distributed data over range : we can use Bucket Sort here
 6: When memory write are costly : use Selection sort, and cycle sort
 7: When adjacent swaps are allowed : Bubble sort, cocktail sort
 8: when array is small : Selection sort, Insertion sort
 9: when avilable memory is small: Shall sort
 10: General purpose sorting alorithms
    Merge sort(Divide and conquore)
    Quick sort
    Heap sort(divide and conquore)
    Hybrid Algorithm:
    mix of 2-3 algorithams
    Tim sort
    Intra sort

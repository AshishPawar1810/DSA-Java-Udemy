package DynamicProgramming;
/*
Dynamic programming :
It is optimization over plain recursion
eg If you are using a recursion and geting diffrent result
storing that result, from that stored result you are taking
required solution that is nothing but dynamic programming

the idea is to reach the solution of sub problem
when there are overlapping sub problem

Two types of dynamic programming
1. Mimoisation (Top down )
2. Tabulation (Bottom up)

Application of Dynamic programming :
1. Bellman ford Algorithm
2. Floyd waterhall Algorithm
3. Diff utility (Longest Common Subsequence) (used in git for checking diff between two files changes)
4. Search closest word (Edit distance, If you are searching wrong words in dictionary it will give simillar match result)
5. Resource allocation

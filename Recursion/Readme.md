A function call itself called as recursion.
Always remember The main principal of using recursion is  we need to divide a problem 
into small problem.

Two type of recursion
1.Direct recursion : call from inside from same function
2.Indirect recursion: call from other function

if you dont stop recursion function call it will not stop at somewhere
run infinite time
to stop it some where we write base case
a condition which help to exit out of loop

Application of Recursion
Many standard aloritham are based of recursion
1.Dynamic programming
2.Backtracking
3.Divide and conquer
4.Tower of Hanoi
5.DFS based travels of graphs
6.Binary search, Quick sort, Merge sort

Note. : Always remember that recursion print function in reverse order
it wait to execution of previous function.

Tail Recursive Function:
A recursion function which has called from last
Means after that no statment will remains to run.
eg. see PrintNtoOne example

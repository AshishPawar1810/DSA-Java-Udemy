Greedy Algorithm :
Are use to optimise problem
we can maximize of minimize the problem
Greedy algorithm may not work always.
Application :
1. finding optimal solution
    -Activity selection
    -Fractional snapsack
    -Job sequencing
    -Prim's Algorithm
    -Kruskal's Algorithm
    -Dijkstra's Algorithm
    -Huffman coding
 2. for NP hard problems like
    Traveling salesman problem

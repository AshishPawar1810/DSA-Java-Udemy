package Hashing;
/*
A method to handle colision called chaining
Here we are inserting keys into hash table
If you want to insert a key to avoid colision then
select a prime number which is near and greater than m
where m is size of hash table
while insertig key in hash table
if refrence memory already occoupied then
add a Linked List node and provide the memory to it
m= no of slots in hash table
n= no keys to be inserted
load factor (alpha)=n/m
Expcected chin length = alpha
Expected time to search = O(1+alpha)
------------------------------------------------

Data stucture to store chains
Linked List : time complex is  Search O(l) Delete O(l)
Dynamic sized array : like ArrayList
Self balancing BST : O(log l)

package Hashing;
/*
mainly use to implement dictionary
were we have key value pairs
also use to implement set
Big benifit of  hashing is it provide
search, insert and delete in O(1) time
Best non premitive data type when we need to search, insert and delete

Hashing Not used for:-
Finding closest value(use AVL tree or Red black tree)
Sorted data(use AVL tree or Red black tree)
prefix searching(if you want to search key)

----------------------------------------------
Application of Hashing :
Dictionary
Database Indexing
Cryptography
Caches
Symbol table in compiler and interpreter
Routers
Getting data from databases
And many MORE...
----------------------------------------------
Direct Address Table:
In Hash map stores value in key pair format
key stores the refrence of value same as pointer in c
In hash map we can represent large values to key
like String, float,double,long which is not possible in array indexing

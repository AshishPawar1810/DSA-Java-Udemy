Hashing Introduction:
Take large keys use function as hash function
convert large keys into small values for index
and store that value in hash table
A hash table is nothing but a refrence table of key

How Hash Function works:
Should always mark to large key to small key
Genrate values from 0 to m-1
Should be fast O(1)
Should uniformly distributed large keys into Hash table slot

Types of hash function
1 h(large_key)=large_key%m  where m is length of hash table
2 for String wighted sum str[]   ="abcd"
3 for string
4 Universal hashing
